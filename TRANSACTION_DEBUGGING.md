# Transaction Debugging Guide

## For Users Unable to Sign Transactions

If you're experiencing issues where transactions won't sign (wallet doesn't pop up), check the browser console for these debug logs:

### 1. Night Booking Transaction Debug Logs

Look for these logs when trying to book nights:

```
üåô Starting multi-night booking:
  - vaultId: [parent vault ID]
  - contractAddress: [factory contract address]
  - chainId: [network chain ID]
  - dates: [array of selected dates]
  - count: [number of nights]
  - masterCode: ***[last 4 chars]

üåô Initiating transaction for night 1 of X:
  - date: [date string]
  - timestamp: [unix timestamp]
  - parentVaultId: [vault ID]
  - contractAddress: [factory address]
  - functionName: "getOrCreateNightVault"
  - args: [parentVaultId, timestamp, masterCode]
```

### 2. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Contract address not found for current chain"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're connected to Sepolia or Arbitrum Sepolia
- Check that your wallet is on the correct network

#### Issue: "Master access code is required"
**Solution**:
- The parent vault's master access code couldn't be loaded
- Try clicking the "üîÑ Retry" button in the confirmation step
- Refresh the page and try again

#### Issue: Transaction doesn't pop up
**Check Console For**:
- Any red "‚ùå" error messages
- The exact error message will help identify the problem

#### Issue: "Invalid parameters" or similar contract errors
**Possible Causes**:
- The dates you selected might not be available anymore
- The parent vault might have restrictions
- Insufficient PYUSD balance (even if approved)

### 3. Master Code Access

#### For Vault Owners:
- Master code is displayed in your vault card on the "My Properties" page
- You can update it using the "‚úèÔ∏è Update" button
- Code must be 4-12 characters

#### For Guests/Reservers:
- Master code is shown after check-in
- Available on the "My Reservations" page
- Copy it using the "üìã Copy" button

### 4. Debug Checklist

Before reporting an issue, please verify:

- [ ] Wallet is connected
- [ ] On correct network (Sepolia or Arbitrum Sepolia)
- [ ] Sufficient PYUSD balance for booking
- [ ] PYUSD approval completed
- [ ] Master access code loaded (check confirmation step)
- [ ] No console errors before transaction attempt
- [ ] Browser allows pop-ups from the site

### 5. Console Commands for Manual Debugging

Open browser console and try:

```javascript
// Check contract address
console.log('Contract:', CONTRACT_ADDRESSES[chainId])

// Check master code
console.log('Master Code Status:', masterCode, hasValidMasterCode)

// Check wallet connection
console.log('Connected Address:', address)
console.log('Connected Chain:', chainId)
```
